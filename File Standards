# File Standards

CC coins are data. They have no logic. Like all data they take up physical space. They can be stored any where data can be stored including ones mind. Infact, CloudCoins are   

## Mind Storage: 

1. Designed to be stored in user's minds;
CCs are designed to be able to be stored in your mind. This is so that CC owners can spend coins without having a computer device. To spend a coin you must know the serial number and the 25 16 byte authenticity numbers. 

To make it easy to remember your coin's serial number, each CC has an address. This address looks like an IP address such as 1.32.64.250. Users can register their coins in DNS servers and give them friendly names. Suppose you had 1000 coins all with different addresses. You can register these in a DNS server with names that are easy to remember. So I could have coins cc1.PaultMockapetris.com through cc1000.PaulMockapetris.com. When I spend them I just remember the next names in line. I can remeber the Authenticity numbers of the coins by using a password as a seed. This seed can be hashed and used to generate the Authencity numbers for all my coins. Now coins can be stored in mind.
